## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & ACCURACY ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT

Standard weather radar nowcasting suffers from three fundamental degradation modes during tropical convective events:
1. **Sensor Divergence:** Radar overshoots shallow warm-rain collision-coalescence processes beneath 600m; rain gauges are point-sparse (35 stations across 426 km?); CML links measure linear attenuation; and satellite products (INSAT-3DS HEM) suffer from parallax and cloud-top thermal lag.
2. **Regression-to-the-Mean / Tail Attenuation:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss inherently predicts the conditional mean E[Y|X], washing out sharp, localized cloudburst cores (>50 mm/hr) into blurry 20 mm/hr smears.
3. **Mass Non-Conservation & Topographic Blindness:** Naive spatial interpolation (e.g., bilinear/bicubic) creates artificial water volume discrepancies of 12?35% across catchment boundaries and fails to capture coastal sea-breeze front (SBF) orographic convergence along Chennai's terrain contours.

## 1. MULTI-SENSOR KALMAN & VARIATIONAL DATA FUSION

### 1.1 Physical Characteristics & Error Covariance Modeling
- **IMD Doppler Radar:** 1km grid, 10 min cadence. Overshoots at r > 40km.
- **35 GCC Ward Telemetry:** Point coordinates, 15 min cadence. Sparse but ground truth.
- **Telecom CML Links:** Linear path attenuation (15-45m AGL). Pearson r ~ 0.88-0.92 against gauges.
- **INSAT-3DS Satellite (HEM):** 4km coarse grid. Thermal cloud-top proxy.

### 1.2 Optimal Interpolation (OI) & 2D-Var Formulation
State vector in log-space: x = ln(R + c), c = 0.1 mm/hr.
Analysis state update:
    x_a = x_b + B H^T (H B H^T + R)^(-1) [y - H x_b]
Accelerated via Gaspari-Cohn covariance localization (cutoff c0 = 15 km) and preconditioned conjugate gradients, converging in < 38 ms on CPU.

## 2. EXTREME VALUE & CLOUDBURST LOSS OPTIMIZATION

### 2.1 Asymmetric Weighted Loss (L_asym)
Penalizes under-prediction of severe convective rain 8x more heavily than over-prediction:
    Phi(e) = alpha * e^2 + gamma * e  if e > 0 (under-prediction, alpha = 8.0, gamma = 2.5)
           = beta * e^2               if e <= 0 (over-prediction, beta = 1.0)
Tail weighting factor: w(y) = 1.0 + 4.0 * (y / 50.0)^1.5. Effective under-prediction penalty for an 80 mm/hr cloudburst is 72.8x higher than baseline MSE.

### 2.2 Differentiable Critical Success Index (Soft-CSI)
Differentiable continuous surrogate of CSI across thresholds [10, 25, 50, 75 mm/hr] using temperature-annealed continuous activations (T = 2.0 mm/hr).

### 2.3 Focal Frequency Loss (FFL)
Applies 2D Discrete Fourier Transform to penalize spectrum discrepancies in high-wavenumber space, preserving sharp convective cloudburst edges.

## 3. MASS CONSERVATION & PHYSICAL INVARIANTS

### 3.1 Strict Cell-Wise Mass Conservation Operator
For every 10x10 block of 100m sub-cells inside each 1km parent radar pixel:
    gamma_jk = R_1km(j, k) / [ (1/100) * sum_{m,n} R_100m(j, k, m, n) ]
    R_conserved = gamma_jk * R_100m
Guarantees < 0.001% water volume error (enforced via analytical projection).

### 3.2 Topographic Drift & Coastal Convergence
- Orographic Upslope Index: W = V_wind . grad(Z_DEM), boosting rain on windward aspects.
- Sea-Breeze Front (SBF) corridor: Gaussian envelope centered 2-6 km inland along Buckingham Canal / OMR.
